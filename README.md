tutoring gf on leetcodes questions 
GET STARTED WITH GITHUB (for liz):
1. cd to some folder on your computer
2. type on command line:
   `git clone COPY_LINK_HERE_SEE_TOPRIGHT_CORNER`
3. `git add . `(add all created/modified files, can also change to subset of files)
4. `git commit -m "whatever comments here"`
5. `git push origin master`
(since only liz and me, no need for git branch (merge) or git rebase)
